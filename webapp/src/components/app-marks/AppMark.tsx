/**
 * Filled, two-tone marks for the eight perspectives, used ONLY by the app
 * launcher.
 *
 * Why these exist at all: Lucide ships no filled icons, so the launcher tile got
 * its visual mass from a coloured wash behind a line glyph. That made an app tile
 * and a rail row look like the same kind of thing. These marks give the launcher
 * its own vocabulary — filled and coloured for "this is an app", line icons
 * everywhere else for "this is somewhere to go". The rail is deliberately
 * untouched; the contrast between the two is the point.
 *
 * Drawn on a 48x48 grid because that is the tile's own size, so the marks are
 * authored at the size they are rendered rather than scaled up from 24.
 *
 * OPTICAL SIZING: the megaphone and the group are scaled about their centres.
 * Equal bounding boxes do not read as equal weight — measured at 64px, the
 * megaphone covered 20% of its box against 33-44% for the others and sat visibly
 * light in the row. The scale factors bring the set to 29-44%.
 *
 * A perspective with no mark here falls back to its line glyph on the hue wash
 * (see WaffleOverlay), so adding a perspective cannot break the launcher.
