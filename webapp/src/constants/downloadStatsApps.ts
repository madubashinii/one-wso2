// Registry of the Download Stats screens, surfaced inside the Engineering
// perspective. The glossary for it is the "Engineering: Download Stats" section
// of the root CONTEXT.md.
//
// ---- why its own file, like misApps.ts -------------------------------------
//
// Download Stats is an app inside Engineering the way MIS is an app inside
// Finance: its own registry, its own path segment, one shell. Its Admin row is
// gated by the Download Stats API's own /user-info answer, folded into the
// rail by id (ENGINEERING_ADMIN_ITEM_ID, the `engineering` adapter in
// visibilityFold.ts), not by One WSO2 capabilities. The registry is spread
// into the Engineering perspective's sections where it is surfaced.
//
// ---- on `requires` --------------------------------------------------------
//
// Only Admin carries it, and there it means RESTRICTED and nothing more — the
// adapter makes the real decision. The other five screens are open to every
// signed-in employee, so they carry none. Same convention as misApps.ts.
