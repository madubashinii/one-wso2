// promotion's own promotionRichText.ts (same library, same allowlist); kept
// as its own copy rather than a shared import because PAR's and Promotion's
// equivalents are already separate per-feature copies, not one shared util.

// read by every OTHER employee who opens the feed, so the read side never
// trusts that the editor sanitized it either.
