// Shared page frame for every Download Stats screen. The title above the tab
// bar names the app, and one sentence sits under that title on every screen,
// the way Banking does. The tab bar names the screen. A
// screen's own name is a heading only while its tab is hidden (Admin, until
// the API has said the caller is an Admin). The shell exists so ONE place owns every
// degraded state and no screen has to remember them (MisShell is the
// precedent). The ladder, in order:
//
//   1. API address not set         → say which config key is missing; ask nothing
//   2. address is http, not local  → refuse to put the token on the wire
//   3. Admin check still in flight → spinner, never a premature denial
//   4. Admin check failed          → an error with Retry, NOT a denial
//   5. the API says not an Admin   → say what Admin is for and who to ask
//   6. the screen
//
// Rungs 3–5 are Admin's alone: the other five screens are open to every
// signed-in employee. The user-info read still runs on those screens, because
// the Admin tab is absent until that read says the caller is an Admin. Rungs
// 4 and 5 stay distinct deliberately — both leave the client holding no
// answer, and collapsing them tells someone whose gateway timed out that they
// lack a role they already have.
//
// ---- how a screen uses it -------------------------------------------------
//
// A page is a thin wrapper, `<DownloadStatsShell screen="downloads">` around
// a body component, and the body holds every query hook. That is load-bearing
// rather than tidy: `children` is mounted only on the last rung, so a body
// inside the shell cannot send a request while the API address is unset or
// the reader is being refused. The heading is the app name from the registry,
// the same name the rail row and a pin's qualifier use. The sentence under
// it is the one shared description, not a per-screen label.
//
// `actions` (a button beside the description, as Admin's "Add tracked repository")
// belongs to the screen, so it appears on the last rung only: a refused reader
// is not offered an action on a screen they cannot open.

// The registry holds one app. Its name is the page heading, so the rail, a
// pin, and this title cannot spell the app two ways.
const appName = DOWNLOAD_STATS_APPS[0].name;

// Tab order is the registry order. Admin is last, and only present once the
// API has said the caller is an Admin — the same rule the rail used when
// these screens were rows.
