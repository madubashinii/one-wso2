# One WSO2 Webapp

WSO2's internal cross-perspective portal: a React 19 + TypeScript + Vite single-page app. Sign-in is
Asgardeo, UI is Oxygen UI, and every environment is configured at runtime through `window.config`,
so one build serves them all.

## Tech stack

- **Core:** [React 19](https://react.dev/)
- **Build tool:** [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/)
- **Language:** [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- **UI library:** [Oxygen UI](https://github.com/wso2/oxygen-ui) (WSO2's MUI-based design system)
- **Data fetching:** [TanStack Query](https://tanstack.com/query/latest)
- **Authentication:** [Asgardeo](https://wso2.com/asgardeo/) via [`@asgardeo/react`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@asgardeo/react)
- **Routing:** [React Router](https://reactrouter.com/) v7
- **Tests:** [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/) + Testing Library, in jsdom

## Getting started

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) 22 (see `.nvmrc`; Vite 7 needs at least 20.19)
- npm — the checked-in lockfile is `package-lock.json`

### Installation

```bash
npm install
cp public/config.js.example public/config.js
```

Fill in `public/config.js`: the Asgardeo tenant and client ID from your Asgardeo application
registration, and the backend URL for each feature you want live (see [Configuration](#configuration)).

`public/config.js` is git-ignored — never commit environment-specific values. At deploy time the
host injects a fresh `config.js` per environment.

### Scripts

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `npm run dev` | dev server at http://localhost:3000 |
| `npm run build` | `tsc -b && vite build` → `dist/` |
| `npm run preview` | serve the production build |
| `npm test` | run the test suite once (`vitest run`) |
| `npm run test:watch` | tests in watch mode |
| `npm run lint` | ESLint |

Before opening a PR: `npx tsc -b && npm test && npm run lint`.

## Configuration

Runtime config is read from `window.config`, set by `public/config.js`.
[`public/config.js.example`](public/config.js.example) is the full, commented list of keys. Build-time
env vars use the `ONE_WSO2_` prefix (`vite.config.ts`).

### App-wide keys

| Key | Description | Example |
|---|---|---|
| `ONE_WSO2_AUTH_BASE_URL` | Asgardeo tenant base URL | `https://api.asgardeo.io/t/<your-org>` |
| `ONE_WSO2_AUTH_CLIENT_ID` | Asgardeo SPA application client ID | `<client-id>` |
| `ONE_WSO2_AUTH_SIGN_IN_REDIRECT_URL` | sign-in callback (must match the Asgardeo app) | `http://localhost:3000` |
| `ONE_WSO2_AUTH_SIGN_OUT_REDIRECT_URL` | sign-out callback | `http://localhost:3000` |
| `ONE_WSO2_ASGARDEO_MYACCOUNT_URL` | optional; defaults to the auth base URL with `api.` swapped for `myaccount.` | |
| `ONE_WSO2_THEME` | `wso2` (default), `acrylicOrange`, `acrylicPurple`, `classic`, `highContrast`, `paleIndigo`, `paleGray` | `wso2` |
| `ONE_WSO2_IDLE_AUTO_SIGN_OUT` | optional; `true` signs out 30 minutes after inactivity instead of waiting at the idle prompt | `false` |
| `ONE_WSO2_PREVIEW_FEATURES` | features built but not released; absent or `false` hides them | `{ umt: false, mis: false }` |

### Feature backends

Every key is optional. When a feature's key is unset, that feature shows a "not connected" notice
naming the key and makes no requests.

| Feature | Key(s) |
|---|---|
| Me profile, My Team, Org Chart, People Ops reports | `ONE_WSO2_PEOPLE_BACKEND_URL` |
| Leave | `ONE_WSO2_LEAVE_BACKEND_URL`, `ONE_WSO2_LEAVE_WEB_APP_URL` |
| Menu | `ONE_WSO2_MENU_BACKEND_URL` |
| Claims and claim approval | `ONE_WSO2_OPD_BACKEND_URL`, `ONE_WSO2_EXPENSE_CLAIMS_BACKEND_URL` |
| Credit card expenses | `ONE_WSO2_CC_EXPENSES_BACKEND_URL` |
| Banking | `ONE_WSO2_BANKING_BACKEND_URL` |
| Subscriptions | `ONE_WSO2_SUBSCRIPTION_BACKEND_URL` |
| Email groups | `ONE_WSO2_EMAIL_GROUPS_BACKEND_URL` |
| PAR | `ONE_WSO2_PAR_BACKEND_URL`, `ONE_WSO2_PAR_*` |
| Promotion | `ONE_WSO2_PROMOTION_BACKEND_URL` |
| Security: Risk Hub, Audit Hub, Admin Console | `ONE_WSO2_GRC_PLATFORM_BACKEND_URL` |
| Security: Evidence Portal | `ONE_WSO2_EVIDENCE_PORTAL_BACKEND_URL` |
| UMT | `ONE_WSO2_UMT_BACKEND_URL` |
| Sales meetings | `ONE_WSO2_REVOPS_BACKEND_URL` |
| CadO2 (quotes and approvals) | `ONE_WSO2_CADO2_BACKEND_URL`, `ONE_WSO2_SALESFORCE_BASE_URL` (also needs `cado2` in `ONE_WSO2_PREVIEW_FEATURES`) |
| Marketing Ops | `ONE_WSO2_MARKETINGOPS_BACKEND_URL`, `ONE_WSO2_MARKETINGOPS_ISAC_URL`, `ONE_WSO2_PARDOT_BASE_URL`, `ONE_WSO2_SALESFORCE_BASE_URL` |
| Due Diligence | `ONE_WSO2_DUE_DILIGENCE_BACKEND_URL` |
| Finance MIS | `ONE_WSO2_MIS_ARR_BACKEND_URL` (also needs `mis` in `ONE_WSO2_PREVIEW_FEATURES`) |
| Infra Portal | `ONE_WSO2_INFRA_BACKEND_URL` |
| CSM (separate app, opened in a new tab) | `ONE_WSO2_CSM_URL` |

## Import aliases

Use `@`-prefixed aliases instead of relative imports beyond one level (defined in `vite.config.ts`,
mirrored in `tsconfig.app.json`):

| Alias | Points to |
|---|---|
| `@` | `src` |
| `@api` | `src/api` |
| `@components` | `src/components` |
| `@config` | `src/config` |
| `@constants` | `src/constants` |
| `@context` | `src/context` |
| `@features` | `src/features` |
| `@hooks` | `src/hooks` |
| `@layouts` | `src/layouts` |
| `@utils` | `src/utils` |

## Perspective model

A **perspective** is a role- or purpose-shaped area of the app. They are registered in
`src/constants/perspectives.ts` (`PERSPECTIVES`), and the launcher (the waffle, top right) lists
them in that order: People Ops, Finance, Legal, CSM, Sales, Knowledge Base, Engineering, Infra
Portal, Marketing Ops, Security and Compliance, and Me. Knowledge Base and Infra Portal are behind
preview flags. UMT is an app inside Engineering, behind its own `umt` flag. CSM is a separate app
opened in a new tab.

- **Me** is the default landing and a default favourite. Each person can choose a different landing
  perspective in Settings.
- **The left rail** is derived from the active perspective's `sections`, which are built from that
  perspective's app-menu registry in `src/constants/*Apps.ts`. The rail and the pages therefore
  can't drift.
- **Access** — `access` means the perspective is built. `requires` on an item hides it from people
  without the capability. Items gated by a backend's own roles go through that feature's gate hook.
  See [conventions](../docs/conventions.md#access-gates).

### Adding a feature to a perspective

1. Add its menu items (id, label, path, and `requires` if restricted) to the perspective's registry
   in `src/constants/`.
2. Add the routes in `src/App.tsx`, gated at the route as well as in the rail.
3. If a backend decides access, add or extend that feature's gate and keep restricted ids fail-closed.
4. Add its runtime config key, commented, to `public/config.js.example`.

## Auth flow

`<AuthGuard>` wraps every route. On mount:

1. If Asgardeo says signed in → render children.
2. If not → store the intended URL in `sessionStorage.one_wso2_post_login_redirect` and call
   `signIn()`. After the redirect completes, the guard restores the original URL.

The access token is attached as `Authorization: Bearer <accessToken>` on API calls
(`@api/http`, `@hooks/useAccessToken`); the API gateway forwards it to the backend as
`x-jwt-assertion`. The id_token is used for identity — backends check its `email` and `groups`
claims.

## Auth debug panel

In dev, a floating **auth** pill appears at the bottom right of every authenticated page. It decodes
the current id_token and access token and shows their claims, which helps when a backend rejects a
token. It isn't included in production builds (`import.meta.env.DEV`).

## Ask Novera palette

`⌘K` (or clicking the top-bar Ask Novera bar) opens the palette. Today it holds the pinned working
set; the Novera assistant is shown as coming soon.

## Branching

Work in a fork of `wso2-open-operations/one-wso2`. Branch off the latest `upstream/main` (never
commit to `main` directly), and rebase on `upstream/main` before opening a PR.
